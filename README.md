# Mental Health Analysis

## Introduction

1 in 5 people live with a mental health condition. And across the population, 1 in every 25 adults is living with a serious mental health condition such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or long-term recurring major depression. As with other serious illnesses, mental illness is not your fault or that of the people around you, but widespread misunderstandings about mental illness remain.

I'm curious to understand more of the demographics surrounding mental health. There have been studies already done that show that some mental illnesses arise due to situational circumstances. 


This project is meant to analyze the different mental illnesses by region of the US, gender and ethnicity in order to see if a pattern emerges.  

## Data Dictionary

## Missing Data / Future Studies
It would be nice to have the age of the people as well, or if they're taking medication and if so what kind..

## Framing Questions
* Is there a correlation between gender and mental illness?
* Is there a corrleation between mental illness and State?
